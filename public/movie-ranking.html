<h1>The Best Movies According to Nishita</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How To Train Your Dragon (parts 1, 2 and 3).</h3>
<p>Loved this movie for its beautiful graphics. It also had an amazing story line. All three parts are great.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Amazing movie on the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer, also known as the "father of the atomic bomb". The screenplay and direction was the best.</p>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>One of the best bollywood movies of all times. It shows how nothing in life is permanent and how we should enjoy and live every moment that we get. Highly recommend watching it.</p>
